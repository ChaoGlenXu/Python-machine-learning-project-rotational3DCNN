# rotational3DCNN

# this project is a team of 4: Christopher Agia, Polina Govorkova, YiFei Tang and Chao glen Xu. we shared the github account called "nicknagi"  to git push some work we did on the computer connected the gpu we used. 

### APS360 Final Project - Rotation Invariant 3D Shape Completion Network

This project aims to design a system capable of reconstructing 3-dimensional objects from a partially complete voxelized representation. Provided that the baseline task is completed with considerable results, we will investigate the effects of partial object rotation on the modelâ€™s performance, and attempt to design for a rotationally invariant reconstruction network.

### How to use

The training script expects two flags currently:
```python
python train.py --config config/path --gpuid gpuid_optional 
```

To evaluate a pre-trained model on a specific set:
```python
python evaluate.py --config config/path --model path/to/model --data data_split --gpuid gpuid_optional
```

### Open Tasks 
- [ ] Design variations of the baseline model (Team)
	- Model should also attempt to classify the model type as a prior for reconstruction
