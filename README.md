### APS360 Final Project - Rotation Invariant 3D Shape Completion Network

This project aims to design a system capable of reconstructing 3-dimensional objects from a partially complete voxelized representation. Provided that the baseline task is completed with considerable results, we will investigate the effects of partial object rotation on the modelâ€™s performance, and attempt to design for a rotationally invariant reconstruction network.

### How to use

The training script expects two flags currently:
```python
python train.py --config config/path --gpuid gpuid_optional 
```

To evaluate a pre-trained model on a specific set:
```python
python evaluate.py --config config/path --model path/to/model --data data_split --gpuid gpuid_optional
```
