### APS360 Final Project - Rotation Invariant 3D Shape Completion Network

This project aims to design a system capable of reconstructing 3-dimensional objects from a partially complete voxelized representation. Provided that the baseline task is completed with considerable results, we will investigate the effects of partial object rotation on the modelâ€™s performance, and attempt to design for a rotationally invariant reconstruction network.

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Configuration files (Chris)
- [x] Configurable training framework, trainer.py (Chris) 
- [x] ShapeNet dataset, dataset/shapenet.py (Chris)
- [x] Partition dataset into independent splits (Chris)
- [x] Baseline PyTorch model (YiFei)
- [x] 3D tensor metric computations (Polina)
- [x] 3D tensor visualization (Polina)
- [x] Training and evaluation loop (Glen)
- [x] Metric tracker and plotting (Chris & Polina)
- [x] Visualization class (Polina)

### Open Tasks 
- [ ] Evaluator class for model evaluation (YiFei)
    - Create dataset flag in argparse
- [ ] Integrate visualization into training / validation (Polina)
    - Create parameters in yaml files for number of samples to visualize
- [ ] Deploy starter code on GPU server (Glen)
    - nvidia-smi --> gpuid flag, attempt training
- [ ] Design variations of the baseline model (Team)

Target deadline: Nov 23 am (Monday)
### Schedule
- Nov 23 (Monday, evening)
- Nov 25 (Wednesday, usual)
- Nov 27 (Friday, evening)
