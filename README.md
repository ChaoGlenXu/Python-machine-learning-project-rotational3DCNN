# rotational3DCNN
APS360 Final Project - Rotation Invariant 3D Shape Completion Network

This project aims to design a system capable of reconstructing 3-dimensional objects from a partially complete voxelized representation. Provided that the baseline task is completed with considerable results, we will investigate the effects of partial object rotation on the modelâ€™s performance, and attempt to design for a rotationally invariant reconstruction network.

### Current Tasks

- [ ] Partition dataset into independent splits (Chris)
- [ ] Evaluater class for model evaluation (YiFei)
- [ ] Visualization class (Polina)
- [ ] Integrate visualization class with Evaluater class (YiFei)
- [ ] Deploy starter code on GPU server (Glen)
- [ ] Design variations of the baseline model (Team)
